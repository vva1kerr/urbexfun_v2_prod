## About Urban Exploration
Urban exploration (often shortened to UrbEx) is the practice of exploring human-made structures, usually abandoned ruins or hidden components of the built environment. UrbEx often has strong ties to photography and historical documentation, helping preserve the memory of forgotten places.
